RegDiffusion is a very fast regulatory network inference algorithm based on probabilistic diffusion model. It works well on genes and is capable to rapidly (<5min) predict biologically verifiable links from large single cell RNA-seq data with 14,000+ genes.

## Installation

RegDiffusion is on pypi.

```
pip install regdiffusion
```

Check out the [this tutorial](https://tuftsbcb.github.io/RegDiffusion/quick_tour.html) for a quick tour of how to use RegDiffusion for your research!

## Quick Tour
This package `regdiffusion` provides the official implementation of the
RegDiffusion algorithm and a set of easy-to-use companion tools to evaluate,
analyze, and visualize the inferred network. We also provide access tools to 
GRN benchmarks and preprocessed single cell datasets for evaluation. 

We tried to keep the top level interface straightforward. Right now, it only 
consists of 4 components: the `RegDiffusionTrainer` class, the `GRN` class, the 
`GRNEvaluator` class, and the `data` module. 

- `RegDiffusionTrainer`: You can use it to train a `RegDiffusion` model by 
  providing log transformed expression data in a `numpy` array. The training
  process could be either started or continued using the `.train()` method. You 
  can export the inferred `GRN` using the `.get_grn()` method.
- `GRN`: The `GRN` class provides a container to save the inferred adjacency
  matrix and the corresponding gene names. You can save the `GRN` object to 
  a local `HDF5` file using the `.to_hdf5()` method and reload the saved file 
  using the `read_hdf5()` function. It also comes with functionalities to 
  export or visualize local regions. For example, you can use the 
  `.visualize_local_neighborhood()` to generate a similar plot as used in 
  the RegDiffusion paper. You can also extract the underlying adjacency list 
  using the `.extract_local_neighborhood()` method.
- `GRNEvaluator`: The ground truth of regulatory relationship often exist as 
  list of edges but the values to be evaluated are often in adjacency matrix. 
  The `GRNEvaluator` class is designed to fill the gap. Right now it supports
  common metrics such as AUROC, AUPR, AUPR Ratio, EP, and EPR. 
- `data` module: Right now, the `data` module includes quick access to BEELINE 
  benchmarks and our preprocessed single cell datasets on mouse microglia. 

## Understanding the Inferred Networks
After the `RegDiffusion` model converges, what you get is simply an 
`adjacency` matrix. When you have thousands or tens of thousands of genes, 
it's getting difficult to analyze matrix at that scale. In our paper, we 
propose a way to analyze the local network by focusing on the genes you care 
the most. Check out the tutorials on the left side for how to perform a similar 
network analysis like the one we did in the paper. We are also working on an 
interactive tool to analyze saved GRN object.

## Inference Speed
Inference on networks with 15,000 genes takes under 5 minutes on an A100 GPU. 
In contrast, previous VAE based models would take more than 4 hours on the same 
device. Even if you don't have access to those fancy GPU cards, RegDiffusion 
still works. Inference on the same large network takes roughly 3 hours on a 
mid-range 12-core CPU.
