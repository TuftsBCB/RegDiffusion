# RegDiffusion: Probabilistic Diffusion-Based Neural Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks

Diffusion model has been widely used in generative AI, especially in the vision domain. In our paper, we proposed RegDiffusion, a diffusion based model for GRN inference. Compared with previous model, RegDiffusion completes inference within a fraction of time and yield better benchmarking results.
